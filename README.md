# Model K Pico
This is the working repository for a custom 75% keyboard designed to be a fusion of the [Cannonkeys Satisfaction75](https://cannonkeys.com/products/gb-satisfaction-75-keyboard-round-2), [CFTKB Mysterium](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/mysterium), and [Envious Data Delirium](https://github.com/Envious-Data/Env-KB). I've designed around the ATmega32A and similar AVR controllers, and I really wanted to try working with the RP2040 as it comes fully prepackaged and works with [KMK](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware) or (with the develop branch *kinda*) [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/develop). The original things that led me to do this were my desire to have the 75% form factor, exposed PCB, rotary encoder for audio, and I2C OLED display all in the same package. My goal was to combine all of these things together while still keeping it reasonable for a layman to make themself.
