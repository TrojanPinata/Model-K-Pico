# Model K Pico
This is the working repository for a custom 75% keyboard designed to be a fusion of the Cannonkeys Satisfaction75, CFTKB Mysterium, and Envious Data Delirium. I've designed around the ATmega32A and similar AVR controllers, but I really wanted to try working with the RP2040 as it comes fully prepackaged and works with KMK or (with the develop branch) QMK. The original things that led me to do this were my desire to have the 75%, exposed PCB, rotary encoder, and I2C OLED display all in the same package. 

But more then that, I really hate the fact that all of the kits available are constantly out of stock, so I want to work to make this project as accessable as possible. I'll put a bill of materials here as well and a guide to how to build/what to design around so anyone can make this or something similar.
